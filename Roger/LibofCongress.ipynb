This will ensure that the Library of Congress and the United States Congress have ongoing access to information from Africa and to official 'born digital' government publications from African nations. The digital initiative adds to the Library’s existing vast collection of resources from Africa and is part of its continuing efforts to seek documentation in all formats to support current research and future scholarly activities. Government ministries websites, such as those concerned with commerce, economic development, social welfare, and foreign affairs, were particularly targeted for archiving. Often these sites are document-rich in all formats, including PDFs, videos and social media, with vital primary source materials such as annual reports, development plans, economic reports, budgets, statistics and foreign affairs. Coverage and priorities among the countries vary greatly.\"],\n",

Collectors and interviewees vary, representing 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and parts of Canada. The recordings submitted for the project were made between circa 1935 and 1984, a number are undated; the bulk of the recordings are dated from 1968 to 1982.  The survey\\'s documentation covers social aspects of English language usage including sex differences; differences between black and white speakers; class distinctions; education; age; literacy; ethnic background for some speakers; and occupational speech, including specialized jargon or vocabulary of various occupations in different regions of the United States. Some of the oral history interviews include storytelling; folklore; family histories; descriptions of holiday celebrations; traditional farming; floods; health care and uses of traditional medicines; descriptions of schools and education; discussions of race relations, politics, and many other topics. The survey was funded by the Center for Applied Linguistics and the National Endowment for the Humanities.'],\n",

It also includes materials related to the career of Kostelanetz's first wife, soprano Lily Pons. Most scores in the collection are arrangements of popular and symphonic music for Kostelanetz's orchestra that were performed for various radio programs in the 1930s and 1940s and for numerous commercial recordings from 1940 to 1979. Materials in the Orchestral Arrangements subseries include manuscript full scores prepared by an arranger or copyist and annotated by Kostelanetz, as well as complete part sets for orchestra. Some of these folders also contain photocopied or printed scores. The Personal Music Library subseries includes printed scores annotated by Kostelanetz for possible orchestral performance, as well as reproductions of unpublished or rare scores found in his personal library.\",\n",
       "     \"The Correspondence series consists of letters, telegrams, and postcards to and from Kostelanetz's personal and professional contacts. Also included are letters from fans of his radio broadcasts and recordings, and from musicians hoping to be featured in his concerts. Notable correspondents include Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Serge Koussevitzky, Eugene Ormandy, Richard Rodgers, Leopold Stokowski, and Arturo Toscanini. Subject files in the collection contain documents from Kostelanetz's professional and personal life. These include programs for concerts not featuring Kostelanetz, correspondence and notes regarding the performance of particular works, documentation of club and union memberships, wardrobe, arrangements, awards, and special events, as well as financial and medical records. Kostelanetz's career as a guest conductor for numerous orchestras around the world and as a regular conductor of the New York Philharmonic is documented in the Concerts and Tours series. Materials include box-office reports, itineraries, program drafts, published programs, newspaper reviews, and contracts, as well as correspondence to and from Kostelanetz's agents.\",\n",
       "     \"Kostelanetz was well-known for his radio broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s. The Radio series contains materials related to Kostelanetz's work as a conductor for programs on the CBS network sponsored by Liggett & Myers Tobacco (The Chesterfield hour), Coca-Cola (The pause that refreshes), Ethyl Gasoline (Tune-up time), and Chrysler (Music millions love). Included are letters between Kostelanetz, radio producers, and sponsors, as well as rosters of orchestra and chorus members, contracts, print advertisements, scripts, and photographs. An additional series, Television and Motion Pictures, contains materials pertaining to Kostelanetz's work for film soundtracks and television broadcasts. These include correspondence, notes on program ideas, cue cards, scripts, shooting schedules, and photographs. The Recordings series contains documentation related to the dozens of studio recordings Kostelanetz made for Columbia Records. The general files include correspondence, royalties, promotional material, contracts, displays for record stores, Columbia Records catalogs, and brochures.

Kostelanetz's corrections, emendations, and notes to musical scores used in recording sessions and concert performances form another series in the collection. Corrections are handwritten on notebook paper and include both musical notation and lists of performance instructions. Most include instructions to Kostelanetz's assistant, Lou Robbins, for incorporating the corrections into the full score.  The Photographs series contains both professional photographs and snapshots that document Kostelanetz's career and personal life from approximately 1935 to 1980.
